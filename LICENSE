IPX, Copyright (c) 2018-2020  ERGO-Code

IPX License: At the user's option, you may use IPX under either the GPL
version 3 license, or the MIT license. You may not use both licenses, nor may
you mix-and-match clauses from each license. To use a license, in the
documentation for your application simply state either of the following,
replacing <YOUR APPLICATION> with the name of your application:

    IPX, Copyright (c) 2018-2020  ERGO-Code
    Used in <YOUR APPLICATION> under the MIT license.

or

    IPX, Copyright (c) 2018-2020  ERGO-Code
    Used in <YOUR APPLICATION> under the GPL v3 license.

In the event that your package <A> includes another package <B> by another
author, and <A> and <B> use IPX under different licenses, you may select one
license to apply to both uses of IPX in the combined application.
