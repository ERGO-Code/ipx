This directory contains logfiles from different LP solvers. They were generated
on a desktop computer with an Intel i5-6500 CPU (4 cores, 3.2GHz, 6MB L3 cache)
and 8GB of physical memory, running Scientifix Linux. There were no other user
jobs running on the system during the execution of the LP solver.

The following software packages were used:

* IPX [commit 82fc9abcfb311f090490dd99375652c330b06a5c] was compiled with g++
  version 4.8.5 and optimization flag -O2. The LAPACK and OpenBLAS libraries
  were those provided by the Scientific Linux package system. BASICLU [commit
  7b41d962cd345057946b84ac41d525efaba4b871] was compiled with gcc version 4.8.5
  and optimization flag -O3. IPX was called through its Julia interface.

* Gurobi version 7.0 was called through its Matlab interface.

The directory structure is <testset>/<solver>/, where <solver> is one of

* gurobi_barrier
* gurobi_dsimplex
* ipx
* ipx_cleanup

The solvers Gurobi barrier, Gurobi dual simplex and IPX were run with default
parameters and a time limit of 36,000 seconds. The final basis from IPX (if
terminated successfully) was given as starting basis to the Gurobi primal or
dual simplex for clean-up. The simplex method was chosen depending on which
infeasibility was smaller. (If the primal infeasibility was smaller than the
dual, then the primal simplex was called.) The logfiles from these simplex runs
are in ipx_cleanup/.

Logfiles are named xxxx.log, where xxxx is the 4-digit ID of the LP model that
is given in the testset file (see testsets/<testset>.tbl). Gurobi barrier and
dual simplex where given the original model, whereas IPX was given a presolved
model generated by the Gurobi LP presolve.
