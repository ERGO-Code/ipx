Optimize a model with 105107 rows, 222217 columns and 848037 nonzeros
Coefficient statistics:
  Matrix range     [3e-08, 2e+06]
  Objective range  [3e-02, 5e+01]
  Bounds range     [1e-03, 3e+08]
  RHS range        [2e-01, 6e+11]
Warning: Model contains large matrix coefficient range
Warning: Model contains large rhs
         Consider reformulating model or setting NumericFocus parameter
         to avoid numerical issues.
