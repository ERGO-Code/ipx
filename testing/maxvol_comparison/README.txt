Run IPM w/o crossover on the LP models pds-20 and nug20 (presolved versions)
with update_heuristic from {0, 1} and  maxvol_tol from {10.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.1}.

The logfile {pds-20|nug20}_heuristic_*.log were obtained with update_heuristic=1
on a desktop computer with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570T CPU @ 2.90GHz and 4MB
L3 cache.

The logfile {pds-20|nug20}_sequential_*.log were obtained with
update_heuristic=0 on compute64d.maths.ed.ac.uk. Their timings are meaningless.
