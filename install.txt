(1) IPX depends on the software package BASICLU (version >= 2.0), which you can
    download from https://github.com/ERGO-Code. Compile it by calling 'make' in
    the top level directory of the package.

(2) In the ipx/ directory edit config.mk as follows:
    - change BASICLUROOT to the location of the basiclu directory
    - change LAPACK and BLAS as necessary for linking with these libraries
    Then call 'make' in the top level directory.

(3) Run the example programs from bin/example/.
